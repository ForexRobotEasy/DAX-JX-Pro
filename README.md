# DAX JX Pro Expert Advisor

This is the code for the DAX JX Pro Expert Advisor, developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor is designed to trade the DAX index using the Donchian channel strategy. It opens long trades when the price breaks above the upper Donchian channel level and opens short trades when the price breaks below the lower Donchian channel level.

## Expert Advisor Inputs
- **LotSize**: The lot size for trading.
- **StopLoss**: The stop loss level in points.
- **TakeProfit**: The take profit level in points.
- **DonchianPeriod**: The period to calculate the Donchian channel levels.

## Initialization Function
The initialization function, `OnInit()`, is called when the Expert Advisor is first loaded. It calculates the Donchian channel levels using the `CalculateDonchianLevels()` function.

## Tick Function
The tick function, `OnTick()`, is called on each tick of the price. It checks if it's time to recalculate the Donchian channel levels and calls the `CalculateDonchianLevels()` function if necessary. It then checks for long and short trade opportunities based on the Donchian channel levels and opens trades accordingly using the `OrderSend()` function.

## Calculate Donchian Channel Levels
The `CalculateDonchianLevels()` function is responsible for calculating the upper and lower Donchian channel levels. It uses the `High[]` and `Low[]` arrays to find the maximum and minimum prices over the specified period, and assigns these values to the `upLevel` and `downLevel` variables.
